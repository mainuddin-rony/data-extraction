Cloth interior w/ power locks, power windows, after market remote start, double din touch screen radio, single 10"" subwoofer and custom box under rear seat. Has vinyl floor instead of carpet which makes for much easier cleaning. Also has a BW turnover ball in the bed. Paint is not perfect by no means but the truck is not beat up either. Has a few minor scratches and rock chips.Has an aftermarket reverse camera but it gets moisture in the lenses after rain and you cant see anything with it. 20x12 Moto Metal 962's wrapped with Nitto 420s with about 1,000 miles on setup. Also have factory LTZ wheels to go with it too but will need tires. All wheels and tires have TPMS sensors. Truck has been deleted for optimum reliability and includes a 5"" exhaust, PPEI switch on the fly tunes (+30-200hp) and transmission tuning for better performance and reliability, has a FASS fuel system. The FASS Mass Flow Return continually polishes the fuel. The MFR removes all types of fuel contaminants (Dirt, Air, Vapor & Water) during each pass through the FASS and increases HP as well as the life of the fuel injectors. The only thing I can think of that it really needs is the exhaust hangers could be redone to hold the pipe up a little bit tighter. The 5'' exhaust was a bolt on kit and utilized factory hangers and the exhaust will rattle a little bit from time to time going over bumps. I would have already fixed it but I do not have a welder handy. I have all of the stock exhaust components I can include as well if needed as well as the factory side steps.This has been a great truck and I do not have to sell but I have no use for the truck anymore so I am considering downsizing to a smaller truck. Might trade for a 4x4 Tacoma or Chevy 1500.

V8. 2 owners, I have the window stickers from both times it was sold. Went through a massive tune up March of last year with some big things done such as having the valves redone along with a new transmission. Air and heat work great. The only bad thing about it is the interior could use some loving and the hood's clear coat is peeling. Brand new battery, all lights and signals work. This is a very, very reliable vehicle and would be perfect for a second vehicle or someone's first.  Also has a CLEAN TITLE.You can contact me at nine zero one 212-0785 I prefer text.

Also a new 1:24 scale model in the box. I'm sure I am leaving a lot out, but I can run through it all with you. The truck has factory keyless entry that works. Ac and heat are great. I am currently working on a few odd ends to get the truck perfect mechanically like the windshield wiper motor and the clock spring so the cruise will work. These repairs will increase the price. The paint looks ok, but it needs to be painted to be perfect. The previous owner had a bed liner and it has rubbed the bed. I bent the hood when a spring failed on me. The truck will come with a OEM black Ford hood along with the previously stated new springs and hinges. There is no rust in the truck at all. I had the carpet out and everything looked great. Truck doesn't smoke. Starts and runs strong. There has been a shift kit installed so it shifts nice and firm. The factory leather is bad on the steering wheel, but a company in Texas will restore it for 300. I will pass that info to the buyer.

It has the Navistar Maxxforce DT Turbo Diesel (210hp) with an Eaton Fuller Ultrashift Automatic Transmission with a Manual Operation Option.  This transmission allows you take advantage of 2 different modes, a manual transmission or a fully automatic transmission. You get the best of both worlds.You will not find a cleaner truck anywhere in the US.Our first step in the reconditioning process is to take our trucks to the local International dealer before anything else is done. They physically go through them from front to back and top to bottom, and then run a computer health check on them (report can be emailed upon request). We do not put any truck up for sale with active codes or known issues.This truck came out of a Large Corporate Fleet. It was lease maintained by a well respected leasing company. One of the largest in the country.Equipped to haul plenty of cargo, this truck can handle up to 25,999lb GVWR (NO CDL REQUIRED). The box is a 26' Morgan Truck Body equipped with a Maxon 3000lb liftgate that has a platform measuring   78"" X 48""  I drove this truck over 800 miles to bring it back to North Carolina with absolutely no issues at all. It has a roll up door with an opening 94"" wide and 97"" tall. Overall box dimensions are 104"" height and 102"" wide. Overall Height clearance is 13'6"".Inside the cab, you'll find an AM/FM Radio with CD Player, Air Conditioning, heat, Cruise control, 12v power outlet. The driver's seat is an air ride bucket seat that has been recovered with new vinyl and the passenger seat is a 2 man bench seat. One of the best features of this truck is the drive train. The Maxxforce DT466 engine provides superior torque and horsepower, the Eaton Fuller Ultrashift Automatic Transmission with manual option gives you the best of both worlds and the Spicer rear is rated as the best in the industry. This is a bulletproof drivetrain combination and if properly cared for can last to 1 million miles or more before any major rebuild is needed. The biggest advantage of the DT466 is the ability to rebuild the engine ""in frame"" which saves thousands of dollars if and when that time comes.CONDITION REPORTThis truck is exceptionally clean. The entire frame from the cab back as well as the front suspension, have been sandblasted down to the bare metal primed and painted (3 coats). The handles, steps, differential, springs and mirrors have all been freshly painted. The engine has been steam cleaned and there are no leaks of any kind. The wheels, hubs and lug nuts have also been sandblasted and repainted. Inside I took the seats out cleaned and repainted the frames. The entire interior was steam cleaned including the back panel and headliner. All of the panels and dash shine and are not dull. The roll up door and steel frame around it has been repainted and look fantastic.  The interior of the box was steam cleaned as well as the oak floor. This truck is immaculate, clean as a pin. You can not appreciate it until you see it in person the pictures just don't do it justice.It is easy to tell that it has not been abused or overworked and obviously cared for properly. It is as quiet of a truck at idle as you will ever find. All of the interior features are functioning normally and there are no mechanical or drivability issues. It is sitting on 22.5"" tires. The tire treads measure: front Left 11/32mm Left rear outside 10/32mm, inside 10/32mm. Right front 9/32mm, right rear outside 10/32mm, inside 10/32mm.

635	Oxford	4100	MS	1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee V8 4x4	https://northmiss.craigslist.org/cto/d/1995-jeep-grand-cherokee-v8/6477423112.html	 good	 8 cylinders	1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee 5.2 V8 with 147,000 miles. Very good overall condition. New 32x11.50R15 Deegan 38 Mud Terrain tires by Mickey Thompson on 15in steel wheels. The jeep is lifted with Rough Country lift but the shocks have been upgraded to Bilstein at 4 corners - very comfortable and smooth ride now. The jeep originally had a full-time 4wd NP249 transfer case (4H-N-4L) but for better offroad performance it was swapped for a more robust part-time NP231 with 2H-4H-N-4L. The Jeep has a good sounding Magnaflow exhaust system. It is an Orvis edition and was the luxury trim of its time. Leather power seats are in excellent  condition front and back. Both heat and AC work. The shocks in the rear hatch are still holding the hatch up, rear wiper and washer both function. There is a sunroof but it has been sealed and is just a see-through glass window now. The jeep was mainly used and built for offload and trail use but was still insured and tagged for in-town commute. I take the front driveshaft out and use the jeep as a backup daily driver.Not interested in any trades.	 4wd	 gas	jeep grand cherokee	13.0	147000.0	 green	 mid-size	2018-01-29  3:04pm	 clean	 automatic		1995.0

I have a 1995 GMC Sonoma for sale.  It's a V6, 4x4, and has 192,xxx original motor miles.  I'm going to be up front and honest people. THIS IS A NORTHERN TRUCK! SO THERE IS SOME RUST DAMAGE! However, I've already replaced all the brake lines, bought new brake calipers and pads for the front.  I also just had all 6 spark plugs replaced so it's running better than ever.  This truck offers power windows and cruise control and has no oil leaks or burning of oil.  I have run it about 50 miles round trip 5 days a week about a month ago and had no issues on a hwy running 70 mph.    Now for the bad.....  the 4x4 will lock in but as soon as you give it some gas the actuator kicks out.  a new actuator should be close to $70 and then the 4x4 will work fine.  Also, the A/C and heat motor needs a new bearing in it.   It only works on full blast and is super loud.  Other than those two things, there is nothing else wrong with it.  It's been an awesome little truck.  PRICE IS $2,000.....   OBO!  got plenty of pics so just text me or call me and i can send you moreNO TRADES PLEASE!I DO NOT NEED HELP SELLING THIS TRUCK!	 4wd	 gas	GMC Sonoma	10.0	192000.0	 red	 mid-size	2018-01-27 12:49am	 clean	 automatic		1995.0

This Lumina was used as an administrative vehicle for the State of Illinois, and was never used for daily police use, pursuit, or for prisoner transport. Recaro racing bucket seats were standard on these police vehicles, and all upholstery is perfect. Cold AC, good heat, and cruise control, power locks, power windows, horn, blinkers, and all lights work normally.

I bought it from the 2nd owner at 165,000 miles with the dent and have been driving it sense. Dent does not hurt anything at all mechanically or electronically. All doors still open, completely watertight, and the Bose amp (on the panel behind the dent) and system work flawlessly. I'm not sure how the dent happened, but it's never caused any issues. Brake lights, blinkers, and all interior lights are LED ($200 worth of LED bulbs), headlights are factory HIDs with a built in washer. Fully loaded with every option offered by GM with the exception of the (now outdated) navigation radio, though it does still have a Bose with XM and AUX built in. Full list of options below. Runs very well and smooth, very sporty motor. This Cadillac has the Performance and Handling Package, and you can definitely tell when you take a curve with the strut bar under the hood. The car has had 3 owners including myself. 80% Highway miles, used mostly for business traveling. Despite the dent, this Cadillac has still been babied its entire life and it shows. Interior is in great condition. No tears or holes in any leather. None of the 3 owners have kids, so expect a near-perfect back seat. Also, I guarantee it to be the shiniest dent you've seen. All 4 tires have less than 40,000 miles. You can reach me at  show contact info. Call or text. No, I'm not a dealership. Just an avid Cadillac driver that knows every square inch of the car being sold. No low ball offers, no trades unless you have another Cadillac equal or better. Thank you.

It is a two owner vehicle with a clean carfax and always serviced at BMW dealership. It is fully loaded and has every option available including soft close doors, comfort access, navigation, iDrive, adaptive headlights, HID lamps, paddle shifters, steering wheel controls, black leather, power seats, sport package, and premium package. I have documented paperwork on every single service done on the car since it was brand new. It has extensive paperwork and services done and has had over $6000 spent in maintenance and services in the past year or so. I am 68 years old and rarely drive her much except to Sunday church and warm summer Saturdays. The paint looks like new as does the interior and it is a very fast sports car. It is completely stock and has new tires on all four corners. I have title in hand and will not negotiate over the phone. This is the lowest mile 335i I've seen out there and for the money you can't beat it. The original price of this 335i was over $60,000 new so this is merely a fraction of the price for a practically brand new car.	 rwd	 gas	BMW 335i	14.0	47000.0	 red		2018-01-17 11:50am	 clean	 automatic		2008.0

This truck is a factory Dauntless Buick 350 powered V8 with a T-15 Borg Warner 3 Speed. This is a very rare, desirable driveline that marks the end of the Kaiser era. The transfer case is a Dana 20 and has Dana 44 axles front and rear.  Odometer says 34,248, but it has probably rolled over. This is not a factory original truck and it is not perfect, please remember this is a 35 year old truck. It has leaks. I replaced the bed with a rust free bed from a 66.  Title is clean and clear.Starting at the engine. The compression numbers are all good when I checked according to the book.  Doesn't overheat and has decent oil pressure at hot idle, around 25.I replaced the original 2bbl carb and intake with a 4bbl quadrajet and a non-egr intake from a Skylark GS 350, choke works perfectly and runs good. It actually gets better gas mileage and has more power with the 4bbl. I have the original air cleaner assembly, that I am including. The original 3 row radiator has been re cored in brass, has new hoses and a new heater core. I removed the original points ignition and converted it to electronic using a petronix III ignitor, New motor mounts. I installed a booster plate for the oil pump. New starter. New fuel pump. New fuels lines and sender. The original 35 amp alternator is still there with a new regulator. It will need a new exhaust manifold at some point, the previous owner welded a leak shut and it still leaks. I have 2 good manifolds that I am including. The transmission is a recently rebuilt t-15, with new synchros, reverse gear and input shaft as well as new case. The reverse gear in this transmission is known to wear and eventually over time it will start to pop out of gear which can become annoying, which was fixed, The clutch is new and the flywheel has been resurfaced. The dana 20 is twin sticked, so you can independently control the axle engagement. All new u joints and the differentials have new gear oil in them. The brakes were originally manual drum-drum and have been updated to disks in the front, The master cylinder has been replaced as well as the proportioning valve for the front disks. Brake lines are all new. The suspension has been lifted 4 inches all around with Hell Creek springs with new shocks. Wheels are older and the tires are 33 inch BF ATs. For the body, I replaced the inner fenders and front valence with non rusted ones. The rockers are new. The bed is in incredible shape. I patched some of cab floors and rhino lined it. I replaced the rear bumper from a later model j10 that doesn't look so utilitarian like the original wrap around. The front seat was pretty much destroyed, so I repaired the springs and threw a cover over it. I have an extra set of seat springs that will go with the sale.I wire wheeled and painted the frame. A previous owner welded and bolted a patch in the frame with c channel.All the dash gauges work. All of the HVAC controls work. All of the exterior lights work. Wipers work. Washer pump does not work. I added on pro comp oil, temp, and volt gauges, as well as a mini tach.	 4wd	 gas	Jeep Gladiator	3.0		 silver	 full-size	2017-12-27 12:46pm	 clean	 manual		1971.0

I am the third owner and am only selling it to pay for an emergency foundation repair that I had to get done. It has 114,200 original miles. Always has been a highway van. The TV and DVD player are under a year old. The Jensen VX7012 DVD Navigation CD XM with bluetooth receiver is brand new. It was installed about a year ago along with a Clarion backup camera that appears on the receiver when the vehicle is in reverse. The previous owner had the paint job done about 2 years ago. He also had the van tinted and added dual exhaust. It gets about 14 mpg highway and 12 in the city. 33 gallon gas tank. Very clean. We've been to Orlando, Chattanooga, Crater of Diamonds Arkansas, Wisconsin, and Michigan this year. The previous owner went to New York and back. It's a solid vehicle. The AC Clutch burned out on the way to Wisconsin. We got that fixed but after we got home from our last trip the AC Compressor has a small leak. All three owners live nearby and I have receipts/service records.The good:New paint job (2015)Low MilesNew Battery (Nov 2016)New Upper and Lower Bushings (Dec 2016)New TV and DVD Player (Dec 2016)New Backup Camera (Nov 2016)New Nav/CD/DVD Receiver with Sirius XM, Pandora, Bluetooth etc. (Nov 2016)Dual Exhaust (2015)New Air Shocks (Dec 2016)New Front and Rear U Joints (Dec 2016)Cleaned Rear Brakes (Dec 2016)New Fuel Pump (Dec 2016)New Tail Shaft Seal (Dec 2016)New Air FilterRegular fluid changesNever been smoked inBlinds are immaculate (RARE)Both interior lights workElectronic seat in back works perfectTires are still in great conditionNOTE: If you want the aftermarket tires/rims as seen on first picture, the previous owner still has them and is selling them.

It's missing the orange indicator showing if you're in Neutral, Drive etc. Not a huge deal, I just count when I shift.2. The Driver's side door window has a short. Sometimes it doesn't work.3.

I replaced the transmission but it's not 4wd anymore , recently the head gasket went out . I don't know to what extent of how bad it is, she still starts up but I no longer wish to put anymore money into it . The tires are still in good condition though & there's floormasters on it . I was using it as a work truck and there's a lot of knicks and knacks wrong with it cosmetically . You can only open the doors from the outside , due to all the handles being broken inside ( I have new handles to replace them , just lost interest in the truck ) . The driver seat needs to be replaced , its no longer aligned to the railing . The driver door needs to be replaced but is manageable .. The truck really can just be parted out or whatever but i'm too young to be building it back up like I planned to . So if you're interested or know someone who can make a profit off it feel free to contact me . I'm selling it for $500 if no one is interested i'm just gonna scrap it .	 rwd	 gas	chevy tahoe lt	4.0		 silver		2018-01-23  9:59pm	 clean	 automatic		1997.0

No problems. No issues. Tires are nearly news. Brakes are good. Oil Change the first week in January at the Volvo of Jackson. Clean bill of health from the dealer, which I can prove via the paperwork/reciept. I have also paid for a Sirius XM Radio subscription for the entire year, so the new owner can look forward to enjoying that. Give me a call (or text) if you have any questions.

Original one owner - drives very tight and you can tell taken care of and extremely low miles2. Low low original miles, go find a 25 year old truck with 47k actual miles3. Body in decent shape for its age4. Interior in excellent shape for its age5. Gas burning work horse, cheap maintenance Used by state agency to pull convention trailer since new List of Negatives: (Pics of each of these in link) 1. Overall paint condition is weak and faded with some rock chips, surface rust and dents and dings in various places.2. Bumper paint beginning to fade on both front and back.3. Drip rail above doors beginning to fade and rust in spots and marker lights on top are faded.4. Slight fiberglass damage to both dual wheel fenders but nothing major.5. Some discoloration to red interior panels.6. Missing fuse cover, dual tank switch, odometer display is very dim and there is one crack in the dash. The doors latches need tightening up, have slack but can be adjusted. The rubber seals around the windows are dry/brittle and need to be repalced. The body/bed of the truck has some dented in spots on the top rails each side - most likely hooking to 5th wheel trailer over the years. This pickup until a few weeks ago was owned by a government agency (State Health Department) in our neighboring State of Alabama, the agency which is about 100 miles from our location purchased the truck new and was used by employees to pull a convention display trailer, traveled around the State every now and then to conventions, was never used for anything else, the State owned/operated it but eventually titled to the City which operates the Health Department although was used only for the purpose of pulling the convention trailer and the majority of the years driven by the same employee (see link for current auto-check history report), no reported damage-wreck history and has been on a fleet maintenance program since new! We purchased the truck directly from the government agency along with several other items, not from an auction, dealer or broker, simply turning this one into cash. After purchasing we checked the fluids and drove it 100 miles to our location, cleaned it, checked fluids again and then took photographs/video for eBay. The truck cranks right up and drives down the highway great with no issues or problems, engine is strong and runs great, transmission shifts out properly, oil pressure is good, engine temperature is good, fluids look good, air conditioning is cold, heat is hot, no dash or warning lights are on, the windshield was discolored so we had a new one put in it, we also had the truck serviced (oil/air filter/fuel filter), tires are in very good condition and can be seen in the photos, truck seems to have plenty of life left in it! Please take a look at the photos and notice the following, this truck only has 47,968 one owner miles, truck is in overall great shape for its age and is a survivor, very few 25 year old f-350 dually's in the world with only 49k miles on it, truck does have several small dings, dents and scratches all around it – the paint on the entire truck is faded but decent - probably would buff/wax but could stand to be repainted, the interior overall is in excellent condition (agency says only a few times has anyone rode in the back seat, the fuse cover is missing, the dual tank switch is broken, the odometer display is weak and dim and there is one crack in the dash, the inside of the pickup bed is in great shape – can see where they had and removed the 5th wheel trailer hitch, other than that truck is real cool, 25-years old, super low miles and with just a few things done to it could be close to perfect! We are selling the truck with a clean-clear title and bill of sale, it will crank up, run and drive, is 100% roadworthy, will make someone a great truck to spend a little money on and have a restored very nice old classic truck that will haul a load! The photos and video were taken the day before the listing on January 18th and show the truck in its current condition! Please take the time to look at complete description, view all the photos and the videos of the pickup so you will know what you are getting.

It's pretty much factory as far as performance stuff goes. It has Power Stop brake pads and slotted and drilled rotors all the way around, a one piece 1000hp aluminum drive shaft, and a K&N air filter. Also, have the original driveshaft, a set of JBA long tube headers and gaskets that go with it. I bought this car in 2010 for my wife to drive back and forth for her last year of school. It's pretty much just driven to work and back by one of us since then. I would be lying if I said I never got on it, and it scares my wife to get on it, but it is far and few between when it happens. We are the 2nd owners, The original owner was literally a older lady that drove it to the store and church. It had around 6800 miles on it when we bought it, and has always been properly maintained. It has been in 2 minor accidents causing only cosmetic damage and was fixed by a professional, licensed, body shop, with genuine GM original parts. Have receipts, paperwork, and pics if needed.  Price is somewhat negotiable, if you don't try to cut me off at the knees. I do have the Carfax on it and it meets their buy back guarantee.

I'm looking to sell it because I work out of California, have been for 3 of those years, and my parents don't drive it other than maybe once a week to keep it running.The only thing wrong with the vehicle is the front axel needs an alignment and some time recently something hit the rear window and cracked it which is why I'm listing it at just below Kelly Blue Book's ""Very Good, Private Party"" value at $19,000. Price is pretty firm, but negotiable.Everything mechanical on the truck is stock.After market parts are as follows:- Bull bar in front- Steps on both sides- The wheels and tires (slightly larger than factory recommended)Features this truck includes are a reverse camera in the rear view mirror (the camera itself is located next to the tailgate handle) and storage behind and beneath the rear seats.ODO is at 82,214, which is below the average mileage.If you have any questions about the truck text me at (six-six-two) three-two-one-9262. Please do not call. Because of my work schedule during the week I'm either at work or asleep and I will return your message a soon as possible."	 rwd	 gas	toyota tacoma	11.0	82241.0	 blue	 full-size	2018-01-13  9:01am	 clean	 automatic		2009.0

Please know that I am extremely detail oriented and when I recondition a truck I do it to the level as if I were going to keep it for myself. Needless to say I go much deeper into the detail on these trucks than anyone I have yet to come across. They are mechanically sound, clean as a pin and as close to brand new as I can get them within reason.

It has the Navistar Maxxforce DT Turbo Diesel (230hp) with an Eaton Fuller Automatic Transmission and Spicer rear end. You will not find a cleaner truck anywhere in the US.Our first step in the reconditioning process is to take our trucks to the local International dealer before anything else is done. They physically go through them from front to back and top to bottom, and then run a computer health check on them (report can be emailed upon request). We do not put any truck up for sale with active codes or known issues.This truck came out of a Large Corporate fleet and was lease maintained through Idealease. Equipped to haul plenty of cargo, this truck can handle up to 25,999lb GVWR (NO CDL REQUIRED). The box is a 26' Utilimaster Truck Body equipped with a Anthony 3000lb self Leveling Liftgate that has a huge  60"" X 84"" Aluminum Platform with cargo catches. Both cargo light inside the box are functional.I drove this truck over 1200 miles to bring it back to North Carolina with absolutely no issues at all. It has a Todco roll up door with an opening 94"" wide and 91 1/2"" tall. Overall box dimensions are 103"" height and 102"" wide. Overall Height clearance is 13'4"". Inside the cab, you'll find an AM/FM Radio with CD Player, Air Conditioning, heat, Cruise control, 12v power outlet. The driver's seat is an air ride bucket seat with adjustable armrest and the passenger is a 2 man bench seat that has been recovered with new vinyl. One of the best features of this truck is the drive train. The Maxxforce DT466 engine provides superior torque and horsepower, the Eaton Fuller automatic transmission is bulletproof and the Spicer rear is rated as the best in the industry. This is an extremely reliable drivetrain combination and if properly cared for can last to 1 million miles or more before any major rebuild is needed. The biggest advantage of the DT466 is the ability to rebuild the engine ""in frame"" which saves thousands of dollars if and when that time comes.CONDITION REPORTThis truck is exceptionally clean. The entire frame from the cab back as well as the front suspension, have been sandblasted down to the bare metal primed and painted (3 coats). The handles, steps, differential, springs and mirrors have all been freshly painted. The engine has been steam cleaned and there are no oil leaks. The wheels, hubs and lug nuts have also been sandblasted and repainted. Inside I took the seats out cleaned and repainted the frames and we installed a new OEM rubber floor mat. The entire interior was steam cleaned including the back panel and headliner. All of the panels and dash shine and are not dull. The box been professionally repainted and this truck looks fantastic. The interior of the box was steam cleaned as well as the oak floor. This truck is immaculate, clean as a pin. You can not appreciate it until you see it in person the pictures just don't do it justice.It is easy to tell that it has not been abused or overworked and obviously cared for properly. It is as quiet of a truck at idle as you will ever find. All of the interior features are functioning normally and there are no mechanical or drivability issues. It is sitting on 22.5"" tires. The tire treads measure: front Left 6/32mm Left rear outside 11/32mm, inside 12/32mm. Right front 7/32mm, right rear outside 12/32mm, inside 11/32mm.

The heat did recently start acting up it chooses to work when it wants and it smoked a couple times when it was started up. Although it still drives perfect. I've been told it's nothing major by my mechanic and could be fixed for a couple hundred bucks. This car is just sitting in my driveway and not being driven. It was my daughters and she got a new car so we just want it gone. BMW are great cars when maintained right so don't let the miles scare you away it has lots of life left.

What I mean by that is that most Firebirds that claim to be 400, 4 speeds where added after market. There were only 4,601 Firebird 400, 4 speeds made in 1969 and out of those there is no documentation of how many of them were convertibles. I have talked to very reliable sources and they all estimate around 1/4 to possibly 1/3 out of those 4,601 to be convertibles. In other words 1,150 to 1,500, but no one can be sure how many are still in existence. The documentation that I have attached was sent to me and highlighted directly from the Pontiac Historical Society after submitting the vin #.The original color, being Champagne, adds even more to the rarity to this car. In all reality it could very well be one of a kind. Either way,  it is a true collectible that will only go up in value.The vehicle is solid and in very good condition as you can tell. Please feel free to call or text me at  show contact info with any questions. I am asking $29,500 OBO.
